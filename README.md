Summarize these into this ReadMe.md file, Same Course, two streams (can be worked out when the course starts)
- Computer Science Principles: Gr 11 and Gr 12 (videos shown to Gr 10)
- Computer Science A: Gr 11 and Gr 12
- History: Gr 11 students score 4's on CSP (like writting a grade 12 diploma exam before taking the course)
