# 2019 Advanced Placement Computer Science A Edition
Notes and Progressions for CSA

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Progressions
- Reminder: routines in the course for each week
- Barron's in Order: Ch 3, Ch 1, etc.
- Complete Labs, See Below in To Include until Section is Created

## Routines throughout the Course

### Vocabulary Development

Tuesday and Thursday Vocabulary Development
- **Purpose**: answer "How do we write about the programs we are supposed to use (CSP)", and, "How do we read the exam (CSA)"
- Where have we seen these words or concepts before (previous projects, current project)
- How do we include other words we need to include that we personally have trouble with

### Using Barron's Computer Science A Resources, Flash Cards

Wednesday and Friday Flash Card Questions and Review
- **Purpose**: review all flash cards twice through the semester
- Read flash questions so students need to work for understanding (never before has evaluation happened like this, usually only project-based), read only twice for students to generate first answer
  - max time: 90 seconds for reading and answer
- Use Document Camera to post flash cards after all flash cards read

Additional Resources used as "Wednesday-Friday Questions"
- True False Questions
- Writing Statement Prompts
- Calculation Questions, see Barron's Flash Cards
  - All levels, General Trivia
  - All levels, Number Conversions
  - CS10: Arithmetic Statements, Relational Statements, Compound Statements
  - CS10: Integer Class Search Functions (max & min values, random, etc.)
  - CS10: FOR & WHILE LOOPS, including Nested FOR (number of execution times, variable skip-counting)
  - CS20: Array Questions
  - CS30: String Functions
  - CS30: `compare.To` Questions
  - CS30: Search Algorithm Comparison Questions
- Summary of all Cue Cards, Algorithm Analysis (only done in AP CS 35)

Add to these a list of "Describe these Functions", seen in CS10, CS20, and CS30 (Pure Java)
