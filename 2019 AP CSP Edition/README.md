Progressions

1. Reviewing Exemplars for Explore and Create, <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam?course=ap-computer-science-principles">AP Website</a>
2. Choosing an Explore Task
   - Reading Blown to Bits for Ideas, <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/excerpts/">PDF online or downloadable</a>
   - Reviewing the Explore Task Rubric, <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-explore-performance-task-scoring-guidelines-2019.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles">Online PDF Copy</a>, from the AP CSP <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course">Course Website</a>
   - Reviewing Explore Task Exemplars, <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam">Scroll through to the middle of the webpage</a>
     - <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam#anchorSG">Specific URL with Anchor to middle of the page</a>
   - Reviewing an Explore Task Checklist, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IyOjvHqghJtX_w_DDZS7MphO7rnvnP2U">2019 Explore Task</a>
   - Reviewing the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles">Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions for Students</a>
     - Taking the basic ideas and work from the Explore Task Checklist and applying these to the expectations of the AP Exam
   - Time to work on concepts and ideas for Explore Task, including research to find scholarly references
   - [] Move to Create Task

3. Choosing a Create Task (a program)
   - Language, instructions to run IDE, how to get an executable
   - Reviewing <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines-2019.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles">Create Task Scoring Guidelines</a>
   - Developing a Case Study for a Program: GUI, States, and Behaviours on an 11x17
   - Developing a Case Study Algorithm with UML (Unified Modelling Language)
     - Structure Diagrams: answers what must be present in the code, plans the pseudocode
     - Behaviour Diagrams: answers how user interacts with program and various states of variables and data structures
     - Interaction Diagrams: choices, decisions, and variable interactions (control and decision)
   - Anticipation: Printing out a full copy of the code
   - Anticipation: Recording a video of the program running
   - Using both case studies, start writing code using language or pseudocode
     - Should illustrate
       - Sequence of code
       - Decisions and Loops
       - Inputs, Variables, and Mutations of Data
       - Outputs and "what happens next"
   - NEXT ...

**CAUTION** about this Progression: not a linear process, especially when progressing through both CSP & CSA Streams

# Ideas to Include

Incremental and Iterative Software Development Ideas
- Write the beginning and end first
- Write the general outline of the main case study (main screen)
  Output Texts, GUI Rectangles, etc.
- Write and test main sections of code with simpler inputs and outputs
    usually to a console
  Write this test into your program
- Write the Driver File first, even in psuedocode if necessary
  Then, fill in the pieces until the program is pieced together
  Note: each piece is tested but program has not run as one unit yet
- Write abstractions to manage complexity in psuedocode, then code these
