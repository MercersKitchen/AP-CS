# Ideas to Include

Purpose: create the content for the presentation
- Computer Science and Algorithms are a tool for Problem Solving

Explore & Create Task Scaffolding after Checklist Review
- Preparing for a Presentation
- Note: this is a little simpler than create and explore tasks
- **For Digital Portfolio Submission, review the Checklists again**

Name of Computer Program

Language Written In, device deployed to

Purpose of Computer Program (Problem being solved, issue being studied, or "something" trying to create)
- Answer one of the following questions to address Software Development Cycle: IDEA, DESIGN, IMPLEMENT, TEST
  - Will you solve a problem with your program?
  - Will you learn something new (something you could not do before, personal interest in the program as a tool)?
  - Will you create something with your program?
  - Will you replicate behavior with your program?
  - Will you generate a tool for others to use with your program?
- Does this program address societal, cultural, or economic concerns
- Describe possible storage, privacy, and security concerns with this program

What abstractions are you using
- What are you representing in real life, nature?
- How is code representing that?
- Data Needed, Data Planning
  - Types of data needed
  - Storage, Reading, Writing
  - Processing, Transforming & Data Memories
- Examples of Abstraction
  - Parameters of a function (variables might be better, explain why)
  - Procedures (use a single algorithm instead of repeating code)
  - Collections, Lists, and Arrays, then & Copying data to use elsewhere
  - API: Application Program Interfaces OR Advanced Program Interfaces
  - Instead of Repeating Code, use a single algorithm
- How does the language deal with different levels of abstractions
  - Examples
    - Processing: use of TABS and Other Files for procedures, methods, classes
    - Processing OOP: use of a driver (void setup & void draw)
    - Pure Java: use of void-main-string-args
- Writing Generic Psuedocode

How the code functions (mapping IPO, include all data structures even if primitive): diagram or flowchart of entire algorithm
- coding first, then writing algorithm in diagram or flowchart with IPO and data structures
- Where do you start
  - How does program start and end?
  - List all the variables and possible mutations
  - Name key decisions and in what order.
  - Name the inputs (mouse, keyboard, voice, variable types, etc.)
  - Name the outputs
  - List the order of inputs or outputs (even if they can happen anytime)
  - Name other "triggers".
  - Identify behaviors or processes that are being repeated.
    - Needed for procedures, methods, or classes
    - Identify any outputs here too
- Summarize sequence of functions, try explaining why some functions need to be executed before others
- Summarize math included (formulae, starting point of variables, boundaries)
  - Includes Booleans, Inequalities (from Booleans or numbers),
- Summarize any selections, even if end-user executed
- Summarize any iterations, even if end-user executed
- Examples
  - Math: random numbers, inequalities & equality, formulae, reasoning
  - Logic: sequencing, selection, iteration
  - Order & sequencing of functions or lines of code (sometimes language specific)
  - Decisions or conditionals: if-then-else, cases, try-catch
  - Iterations or loops: FOR or WHILE
  - Algorithms: Ratios for GUI, Counters, Timer
- Questions Graders will use for algorithm evaluation
  - What does each algorithm called by your algorithm do alone?
  - What do the algorithms called by you algorithm do together
  - How does your algorithm connect to the purpose of your program
  - What mathematical concepts does your algorithm use
  - Where does your algorithm use logical concepts

Features of End-user Experience that connect to the program's Purpose
- Summarized by Case Study, uses clean design
  - List all features
  - List possible effects when end-user interacts with program (benefits or harms)

- Explain intended purpose of each feature (note: end-user can take it to next step)

Adding Comments to Program Code, "make it read like a book"
- Use AP Java DOC expectations

Reflection & Solution Stories (Difficulties or Opportunities)
- Revision stories illustrating solutions
- Incremental changes: large scale algorithmic changes (must have algorithm to start with)
- Iterative changes: smaller changes related to functions, parameters (here, debugging is a tool)
- Questions to Focus on
  - When "it" happened
  - How the solution helped you meet the purpose of your program
  - How the difficulty was resolved
  - How the opportunity led to program improvement
  - Whether "it" was independent or collaborative

Example Reflection Questions

Answers how this purpose affected me, personally
Answers how this purpose inspired me to learn more about CS
Answers how this purpose relates to my dream job
Answers how this purpose will affect my spare time

Notes about Flow Charts

Flow Chart Symbols and Related Exam Questions
- Oval: start or end of program
  Include Language Specific Lines of Code (buttons, exit, quit, etc.)
- Parallelogram: input or output of data, text
- Rectangle: key logical steps, has one input and one output
- Rhombus: key decision, one or more inputs, one Boolean Output (true-false)
- Arrow: shows relationships between other shapes
  Represents flow of information and/or logical path of code
  Shows iterations (FOR or WHILE Loops, decision at beginning or end)
- Best to use paper and pencil for this
  Take images, add reasons why, etc.
  ?Use a snipping tools to help with writing responses in digital portfolio?
  Also create case studies
- Online Tools
  Raptor (raptor.martincarlisle.com)
  Online Flowchart Maker (draw.io): share via GitHub, Drive, etc.
  MindMeister (mindmeister.com)
  Padlet (padlet.com)

Incremental and Iterative Software Development Ideas
- Write the beginning and end first
- Write the general outline of the main case study (main screen)
  Output Texts, GUI Rectangles, etc.
- Write and test main sections of code with simpler inputs and outputs
    usually to a console
  Write this test into your program
- Write the Driver File first, even in psuedocode if necessary
  Then, fill in the pieces until the program is pieced together
  Note: each piece is tested but program has not run as one unit yet
- Write abstractions to manage complexity in psuedocode, then code these
